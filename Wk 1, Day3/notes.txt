Responsive Web Design

Our website should respond to the user's device; changing the layout to accommodate small screens, different input methods, etc.

  Keyboard vs Touchscreen
  network speed, and data limits


HOW TO ACCOMMODATE:
  Outdated Practice: m.mysite.com 'm' signifies mobile.
    Problems: sites incorrectly guess what device you're on.
              redirected to different site ask for specific get home page mobile
              having 2 sites doubles development effort, doubles chances for bugs.

  Good Practices:
      when building a responsive site, we're mostly concerned with the width of the user's browser.
                Desktop-first, graceful degradation
                Mobile-first, progressive enhancement (preferred method in 2016)

  Relative Units:
    em: the size of a capital M in the current font. Always relative to the immediate parent's font size.

    rem: always relative to the font-size on the HTML tag.

Bootstrap:
  a CSS framework made by Twitter.
  main benefit is Grid System...

  GRID SYSTEM:
    Device sizes: XS, SM, MD, LG
    12 columns make up the grid
    (a column based layout)
