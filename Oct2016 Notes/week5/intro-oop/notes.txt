Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a style of programming that relies on creating objects in a structured manner, using CLASSES.

CLASSES let us define a structure for objects, and then INSTANTIATE many objects from that class.
The CLASS defines a list of PROPERTIES that each object of your class must have.
PROPERTIES that are functions can be referred to more specifically as METHODS

INSTANCES of our CLASS are OBJECTS

javascript does not have a built-in notion of CLASSES. What we do have are prototypes. 


In javascript, instead of a CLASS keyword, we use constructor functions.
