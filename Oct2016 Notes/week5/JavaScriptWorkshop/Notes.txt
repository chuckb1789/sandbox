JavaScript Workshop

JS Types:
    Primitive types:
        -string: 'hello' or "hello"
        -number: 276
        -boolean: true/false
        -undefined (defined with a value of nothing)
        -null (not even defined)

    Non-primitive types:
        -arrays 
        -objects   
        -functions

var name

Valid variable names: must start with a letter, _, $

Valid:
    foo
    result
    result2
    $$billyall

Not valid:
    1result
    2fast2furious
    hello-world

PEMDAS 
    Parenthesis
    Exponents
    Multiplication
    Division
    Addition
    Subtraction

Operators
    * Multiplication
    + Addition
    - Subtraction
    / Division
    % Modulus  

Comparison Operators
    == is equal?
    === is it strictly equal? (type is also the same)
    < less than
    <= less than or equals
    > greater than
    >= greater than or equals

Logical Operators
    ! not (negating a value)
    != not equal
    && and
    || or

Conditional Statements

if()

Truthey/Falsey
    Any number except 0 or NaN (not a number) 
    Any String that is not empty 
    null and undefined are always falsey  
    any other value is truthey


Incrementers/Decrementers
var i = 0

i = i + 1
i++ // shorthand for post increment (returns the value before it increments)
++i // shorthand for pre increment (returns the value after it increments)

i = i - 1
i-- // shorthand for post decrement (returns the value before it decrements)
--i // shorthand for pre decrement (returns the value after it decrements)

i = i + 10 // long way to increment by 10 (or any number is valid)
i+=10 // shorthand for incrementing by 10
i+10 // give me the value of i + 10, but don't set the value to anything

i *= 4
i /= 2

Loops

for(initializer; conditional (termination case); incrementer) {
    // what to do inside of the loop
}

var num = 0;
while(num < 100) {
    num++;
}

objects


Collection: an array of objects
