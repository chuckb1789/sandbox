Express is a JS framework (node module)
    -It helps us write a web server in a lot less code than would be required with a vanilla node server
    -It is similar to Angular on the front end - everything Angular does can be done with vanilla JS, but it would take a ton of code

Client/Server
    -Client: requests resources from a server (examples: browser/users, internet of things devices)
    -Server: accepts connections from clients and sends them requested resources (example: a machine rented from DigitalOcean in which we install our full stack app on)
        -Servers don't really do anything until they receive requests from clients
        -On the HTTP protocol, servers do not proactively send messages to clients, they simply respond to requests (one HTTP request = one HTTP response)
        -Servers MUST SEND A RESPONSE for every request, even if the response doesn't contain any data (the client will sit and wait for the response)

    Client/Server communication metaphor: 
        Think of the server as a restaurant. The clients are the customers. The wait staff is like the browser. The kitchen is the server. The food is the response to requests.

What actually happens when we send an HTTP request?
    1.) The user makes a request to www.google.com
    2.) The browser sends a request to the DNS (Domain Name System), which finds the IP address of the server requested (resolving a subdomain may contain multiple DNS requests)
    3.) The browser sends the request to the IP address
    4.) The server receives the request and processes it
    5.) The server sends the response back to the client
    This is the case for ALL files (html, js, css)

What information is contained in an HTTP request?
Bare minimum:
    -Method type: GET/POST/PUT/DELETE (and some others that are infrequently used)
    -URL: what resource is being requested? (home page '/', about page '/about', etc)
Optional:
    -Headers: contain more information about the request
    -Body: for some request types (POST/PUT have a body, GET does not - it passes data through the query string), allows you to attach more data to the request (for example, sending a user's email and password to the server, so the user can login)

Plain text is really the only thing we can send over the internet (using HTTP)
